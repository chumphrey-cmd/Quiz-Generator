# Simple Quiz Generator

A local and super simple web-based exam/quiz application that allows users to import questions from text files and take interactive quizzes with real-time feedback. 

Personally I just wanted a way to quickly take exams on the content that I was reading.

## Generate Questions to be Ingested

1. If using PDFs, use my [PDF-Extractor](https://github.com/chumphrey-cmd/Password-Protected-PDF-Extractor) tool get the text from courses that you're working on.

2. Use something like Google's [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) as a RAG layer to query and generate multiple choice questions matching the **Question File Format** below.

## Question File Format

Questions **MUST** be formatted as follows:

```
1. Question text here?
A. First answer
B. Second answer
C. Third answer*
D. Fourth answer

2. Next question...
```
- One blank line between questions
- Correct answer marked with asterisk (*)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chumphrey-cmd/QA-Generator.git
```

2. Open `quiz.html` in a modern web browser
3. Import a properly formatted `.txt` file
4. Start taking the quiz

## To-Do List:

### DONE ✅
* **Temporary development work around:** To bypass CORS error that is generated by access quiz.html from `file://`, run a initiate a Python Simple Server in the directory of where quiz.html is hosted via `python -m http.server [port#]`.
* **CORS Issue Resolved:** System Properties > Environment Variables > Update **user** and **System** variables by adding `OLLAMA_ORIGINS "*"`
* **Additional Reasoning:** Currently there's an explain button that takes the content of the questions and provides an answer, I now want the ability to chat and interact with the question with a embedded interface
* **Additional LLM Features:**
  * Currently the Ollama models are hard-coded. I would like the application the ability to identify which models you currently have loaded and provide you the ability to select the model of choice.
  * Include API syntax for other Gemini models
  * Integrate session-only, per-question chat history
* **Review Missed Questions:** Have the ability for your most missed questions to be marked and reviewed rather than having to retake the entire quiz all over again. Be provided a "Review button" at the end of the quiz/test that allows you to review only your missed or questions marked for review!

### In Progress... ⏳

* **Local Database:** 
  * Be able to store and save your quiz questions into a backend, local database for reference later...
  * Implement the ability to specify the number of questions that you want to display at a time (e.g., 90/120 total questions)
  * Have the ability to pause, save, or reset your current session while you are reviewing. 
  * Have the ability to re-initiate your current saved session to restart your progress.

* **UI/UX:** 
  * Create a nice splash/introduction page/logo for the tool when the user first opens up the quiz.html file.
  * Ensure that the entire quiz header is pinned while we scroll down the MC Qs.
  * Have the "submit button" for each question take you to the next question, similar to exam like conditions. 
  * Have the ability to specify two settings for the exam that you are going to take (e.g., A. Study Session and B. Exam Conditions)
  * Implement an "Explain (✨)" icon to replace the current "Explain" button.
  * Remove the Timer ON/OFF feature because the Resume/Pause/Reset features handle the timer functionality
