# Simple Quiz Generator

A local and super simple web-based exam/quiz application that allows users to import questions from text files and take interactive quizzes with real-time feedback. 

Personally I just wanted a way to quickly take exams on the content that I was reading.

## Generate Questions to be Ingested

1. If using PDFs, use my [PDF-Extractor](https://github.com/chumphrey-cmd/Password-Protected-PDF-Extractor) tool get the text from courses that you're working on.

2. Use something like Google's [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) as a RAG layer to query and generate multiple choice questions matching the **Question File Format** below.

## Question File Format

Questions **MUST** be formatted as follows:

```
1. Question text here?
A. First answer
B. Second answer
C. Third answer*
D. Fourth answer

2. Next question...
```
- One blank line between questions
- Correct answer marked with asterisk (*)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chumphrey-cmd/QA-Generator.git
```

2. Open `quiz.html` in a modern web browser
3. Import a properly formatted `.txt` file
4. Start taking the quiz

## Updates to Include to `readme.md`

* **Temporary development work around:** To bypass CORS error that is generated by access quiz.html from `file://`, run a initiate a Python Simple Server in the directory of where quiz.html is hosted via `python -m http.server [port#]`.
* **CORS Issue Resolved:** System Properties > Environment Variables > Update **user** and **System** variables by adding `OLLAMA_ORIGINS "*"`
